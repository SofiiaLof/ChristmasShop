           <p>
             With Christmas right around the corner, you might be thinking About
             getting yourself a dog, as a gift to your family. 
             We at santa's workshop would recommend you take on a rescue!
            Welcoming a rescue into your home can change both of your lives. 
            For the dog, it gives them a new place to live and a more secure life.</p>
            <p>
              For you, a rescue could be a loving, kind pet that brings you loyalty and love. As such,
               it’s no wonder that rescue dog adoption has risen considerably over recent months.

            </p>
            <p>
          The success of adopting a rescue pup depends on many factors,
           including the initial weeks that your new pet spends in your home.
            </p>
            <p>
            We’ve put together this practical guide to helping your new pet
             settle and become an indispensable part of your family.
            </p>

           <div class="h-box">
              <h4>
            Make Your New Pet A Safe Place </h4>
           </div>
           
             <p>On their first visit to their new home, keep your rescue dog in the lead and give them a guided tour. Walk them around the yard and show them the main property.

If there are any areas out of bounds to your pet, don’t take them there. Instead,
 walk them around the space where they will be living.</p>
              <p>Keeping your dog on a lead will make them feel calm and give them the chance
                 to adjust to the new sights and smells in your home.

                 Once you’ve been around your home,
           you could consider taking your dog to their safe space and then letting them off the lead.</p>
        <p>Place the crate in a corner private corner of one of the quieter rooms.
   If your dog finds a corner that they prefer to relax in, then move the crate there, so they have access to their comfortable space.

When your dog is in its safe space, please do not disturb them or allow other members of your family to do so, as this could make your dog feel cornered.

As your rescue pup becomes more confident and feels more at home in your house,
 they might let other pets or children join them in their safe space.</p>

           <div class="h-box">
            <h4>Create A Routine</h4>
           </div>
          
           <p>Routine can be soothing and reassuring to pets and people alike. As such, when you bring a rescue pup home, you should try to create a routine for them as soon as possible.

That means setting a time for when they eat, when they go for walks, and when the lights go out, and they get to go to sleep at night.</p>
<p>By creating a routine, you’ll make your dog feel calm and allow them to feel reassured that they know when their next meal is coming from and when everything happens.

This approach is particularly valuable for rescue pets who’ve been abandoned and had a challenging former life. They might be insecure and frightened so that a routine could soothe them.</p>
